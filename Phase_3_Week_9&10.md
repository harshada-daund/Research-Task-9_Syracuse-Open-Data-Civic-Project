Phase 3 – Testing, Validation & Feature Completion (Weeks 9–10)

Weeks 9–10 completed Phase 3 by hardening the Syracuse Open Data Housing Violations analysis pipeline, expanding quality assurance safeguards, and declaring the civic analysis feature-complete. Week 9 focused on reliability and validation: unit tests were extended to cover critical transformations including safe datetime parsing, handling of missing or malformed closure values, normalization of violation categories and neighborhood fields, resolution time calculations, and all aggregations feeding the project’s summary tables and visualizations. Integration testing verified full end-to-end runs from raw CSV ingestion (kept local per data governance policy) through data cleaning, aggregation, QA validation, and generation of processed outputs. Automated validation summaries now execute after cleaning, reporting row counts before and after transformations, missingness in key fields such as status and dates, and anomalies including negative resolution days or inconsistent date ordering. Edge-case handling was strengthened for empty datasets, all-missing closure dates, malformed categorical entries, sparse neighborhood groupings, and filter combinations that yield no results, with explicit warnings replacing silent failures.

Week 10 finalized the feature set and documentation. The reproducible pipeline cleanly separates acquisition, transformation, analysis, and presentation through modular components in src/, orchestrated by a single end-to-end execution script. All production outputs—including year-over-year violation trends, open versus closed case summaries, resolution time statistics, and neighborhood-level distribution insights—are programmatically generated and saved to the outputs/ directory. Documentation was brought to submission quality with an updated README, clarified architecture notes aligned to implemented modules, expanded QA documentation, and a clearly stated limitations section emphasizing responsible, descriptive interpretation of civic data. Version control reflects meaningful commits covering feature additions, refactors, QA expansion, testing, and documentation updates. The result is a feature-complete, well-tested, and fully documented Phase 3 artifact that is ready for Phase 4 deployment, monitoring, or advanced analytical enhancements.
